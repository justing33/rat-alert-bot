A bot developed from rat intelligence to play Command and Conquer: Red Alert (Remastered)

## Configuration
This bot makes some assumptions based on default game hotkeys for both Allies and Soviets.  For example..
'd' builds small power plants, 'h' centers the view on the players construction yard,  etc..  It is 
recommended to reset your key bindings to defaults to use this bot correctly.  Perhaps if the rats 
huff some more cheese puffs it will be smarter later.

The AI bot is currently hardcoded to only work and perform a build order from the 
top left spawn of Arena Valley which is currently a quickmatch ladder map.

* Branching Strategy:
  * Main - the main branch that will be playable and versioned and essentially 'prod' releases
  * Develop - a work in progress branch that feature branches will be merged into
